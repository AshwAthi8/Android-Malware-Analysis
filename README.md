# malwaric-web

### Implementation :

In this tool our main aim being, static analysis of the apk, we have created the tool such that each apk is picked up and the permissions as well as the number of embedded apks are extracted and saved to a csv which is fed to the trained ML model which will predict whether the application is malicious, benign or even an adware or a Riskware.

Firstly each apk is used to extract their permissions and then checked for embedded files from where further apks are extracted for permissions and this goes on recursively until no more apks are found. Once all the files as well as their permissions are extracted, they are sorted and segregated as Benign or malicious and saved to the csv which is later used for further analysis.

### Instalations :

	- Apktool
	- Androlyze
	- pickle
### How to run :

Python3 <script.py>

Implementation phases:
  - Extraction of permissions from the apks.
  - Extraction of source code.
  - Tokenisation of source code.
  - Work on training the model for both the phases.
